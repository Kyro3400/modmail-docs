# Railway

## What is Railway?

Railway is a deployment platform where you can provision infrastructure, develop with that infrastructure locally, and then deploy to the cloud.&#x20;

## Requirements

* A credit card (for verification only).
* Stable internet connection.
* An email account.
* You have completed the initial steps: [invited your bot](./#create-a-discord-bot) and [created a MongoDB database](./#create-a-mongodb-database).

## Costs

Railway provides a **free** "Starter" plan. This plan allows you to try out their platform for free without requiring a credit card\*. Your bot will be online for 10 days after signing up.

To keep your bot running 24/7, you'll need to sign up for their "Developer" plan. This plan is also **free**, but you will need to verify using your credit card, as it's to prevent abuse on their systems.

\* May be required for some users.
