# Heroku

## What is Heroku? <a href="#what-is-railway" id="what-is-railway"></a>

Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.

## Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

* A credit card (for payment and verification).
* Stable internet connection.
* An email account.
* You have completed the initial steps: [invited your bot](./#create-a-discord-bot) and [created a MongoDB database](./#create-a-mongodb-database).

## Costs

Unfortunately, Heroku is no longer free-of-charge. You will need at least their Eco plan, which currently costs $5 USD per month. See their [pricing page ](https://www.heroku.com/pricing)for more info and up-to-date prices.

If you are a higher-education student, you may be eligible for their [student offer](https://www.heroku.com/github-students), which grants you $13 USD of credits per month for 12 monthsâ€”enough to host Modmail free for one year.
