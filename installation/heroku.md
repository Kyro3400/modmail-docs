# Heroku

## What is Heroku? <a href="#what-is-railway" id="what-is-railway"></a>

Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.

## Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

* A credit card (for payment and verification).
* An email account.
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) account.
* You have completed the initial steps: [invited your bot](./#create-a-discord-bot) and [created a MongoDB database](./#create-a-mongodb-database).

## Costs

Unfortunately, Heroku is no longer free-of-charge. You will need at least their Eco plan, which currently costs $5 USD per month. See their [pricing page ](https://www.heroku.com/pricing)for more info and up-to-date prices.

If you are a higher-education student, you may be eligible for their [student offer](https://www.heroku.com/github-students), which grants you $13 USD of credits per month for 12 monthsâ€”enough to host Modmail free for one year.

## Fork our GitHub repositories

You will need to fork our repositories to deploy onto Heroku.

Make sure you're logged in to [GitHub](https://github.com/). You will need to fork **two** repositories.&#x20;

First we fork the Modmail repository. Head over to [https://github.com/kyb3rr/modmail/fork](https://github.com/kyb3rr/modmail/fork), leave all the settings as default, and click **Create fork**.

Next do the same for the Logviewer repository by heading over to [https://github.com/kyb3r/logviewer/fork](https://github.com/kyb3r/logviewer/fork), leave all the settings as default, and click **Create fork**.

Next, to keep your Modmail and Logviewer up to date, you will need to install the [Pull app](https://github.com/apps/pull). Simply head over to [https://github.com/apps/pull](https://github.com/apps/pull), click **Install**, choose **Only select repositories**, then select **both** the Modmail and Logviewer repositories that you forked in the previous step.&#x20;

Your GitHub should now be all set. Next step, [create a Heroku account](heroku.md#create-a-heroku-account) to deploy your bot.
