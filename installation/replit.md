## What is Replit?

Replit is a platform for creating and sharing software. You can write your code and host it all in the same place.

Replit often is unstable for hosting Modmail bots. Your bot may shutdown without any notice.&#x20;

## Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

* An email account.
* You have completed the initial steps: [invited your bot](./#create-a-discord-bot) and [created a MongoDB database](./#create-a-mongodb-database).

## Costs

Hosting Modmail on Replit is free. However, this requires using an exploit. If you prefer to use Replit using their officially supported method, you will need to purchase their "Hacker" plan, which costs $7 USD per month.
