## Installing Docker Engine

Depending on which operating system you are running, you should follow the specific [guides](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

* [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)
* [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
* [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
* [RedHat](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/)
* [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

When installing, make sure you install `docker-compose-plugin` as this plugin will power the bot and additional services needed.
