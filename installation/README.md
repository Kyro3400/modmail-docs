# Installation

Modmail is a self-hosted bot. This unfortunately means that there's **no** public bot invite. Furthermore, due to the inner workings of the bot and its highly customisable interfaces, you will need to host your own dedicated Modmail bot.&#x20;

This section provides setup instructions for Modmail on many hosting methods, both **free and paid**.

Here are the basic requirements for hosting your Modmail bot. You will find instructions on obtaining and using them in later sub-sections.

*   A Discord account.

    You will need to create a Discord bot under your account.
*   A MongoDB instance.

    Modmail will store its internal data to this database.
*   A hosting server.
