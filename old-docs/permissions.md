# Permissions

Modmail comes with an advanced permission system. The different permission levels are:

* Owner \[5]
* Administrator \[4]
* Moderator \[3]
* Supporter \[2]
* Regular \[1]

To see which commands are available to which permission, you can see the numbers next to the command in the help menu.
